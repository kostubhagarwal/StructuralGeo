# StructuralGeo

**StructuralGeo** is a Python package designed for creating, visualizing, and randomizing synthetic structural geology data. The package leverages NumPy for efficient data handling and PyVista for powerful 3D visualization. It includes a randomization scheme within the generation and dataset modules, enabling the creation of an extensive synthetic dataset for use with PyTorch or similar frameworks.

### Project Installation
To install StructuralGeo to your Python environment, first clone this repo into a working directory and change directory into the cloned folder.

```bash
cd path/to/my/project
git clone https://github.com/eldadHaber/StructuralGeo
cd StructuralGeo
```

>[!NOTE]
> Before continuing with installation you may want to create a virtual environment to install the package into, using a tool such as `venv` or `conda`.

The package and its dependencies can be installed using the `setup.py` file and the `pip install` command. The `-e` flag installs the package as editable, allowing changes to the package to be reflected immedeately in the Python environment, and is recommended for development.

```bash
cd path/to/my/project/StructuralGeo
pip install -e .
```

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The package has a dependency on PyTorch for using the dataset module which is not automatically installed. PyTorch can be installed using the instructions on the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). 

After installation, the package can be imported into your Python environment with the following command:

```python
import geogen
```
### Dataset Quick Start

The streaming dataset is initialized with:
- `model_bounds`: ((xmin, xmax), (ymin, ymax), (zmin, zmax)) in meters. Note the randomization scheme of Geowords is designed for models that are ((-3840, 3840), (-3840, 3840), (-1920, 1920)) in size.
- `model_resolution`: Resolution of the meshgrid, along with bounds determines the voxel size.
- `generator_config`: Path pointing to a configuration file or CSV with the markov matrix weights, if None, uses a default set.
- `dataset_size`: Artifical number of samples in one epoch. The dataset does not reuse samples across epochs and always streams new ones.
- `device`: Device to load model tensors

```python
from geogen.dataset import GeoData3DStreamingDataset

# Decide on bounds and resolution for the model
bounds = ((-3840, 3840), (-3840, 3840), (-1920, 1920))
resolution = (128, 128, 64)

# Dataset, Loader and Batch
dataset = GeoData3DStreamingDataset(
    model_bounds=bounds, model_resolution=resolution
)
loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=4, shuffle=True, num_workers=4)
batch = next(iter(loader))

batch_shape = batch.shape
print(f"Datlaloader yields a sample of shape: {batch_shape}")
```
A quickstart guide is found in `code_examples/quickstart.py`

#### Jupyter Notebook Viewing

The visualization is handled with Pyvista which may require additional configuration for Jupyter Notebook to view the model iteractively. 

The type of visualization backend for Jupyter can be set to `static`, `html` or `trame`.

- `static` will render non-interactive plots quickly, recommended for quick testing.
- `html` will render interactive plots in the notebook but is slower to build the viewer than static. The model can be rotated and zoomed in the notebook.
- `trame` will render interactive plots in the notebook through a viewer with menu options. It takes a while to load and is slower to render than the other options.

The backend can be specified for all Pyvista plots at the top of the notebook with the following command:

```python
pyvista.set_jupyter_backend('static') # or 'html' or 'trame'
```

On an individual Pyvista plot that is returned by geovis package, the backend can be overridden with the following example command:

```python
p = geovis.volview(model)
p.window_size = window_size
p.add_title(title='Sedimentation Ontop of Bedrock Model', font_size=8)
p.show(jupyter_backend='static') 
```

To install the trame framework, use the following command:

```bash
pip install 'jupyterlab>=3' ipywidgets 'pyvista[all,trame]'   
```

If `trame` is not installed the jupyter backend should be set to static which will render non-interactive plots. See examples folder for implementation, or read more at the [Pyvista documentation](https://tutorial.pyvista.org/tutorial/00_jupyter/index.html).

More information can be found in the code_examples folder.
